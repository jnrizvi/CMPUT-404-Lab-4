Question 1:
https://github.com/jnrizvi/CMPUT-404-Lab-4

Question 2:
It shows the defult debug Django page with the rocket ship animation saying
The install worked successfully! Congratulations!

Question 3:
A blank page with the text: "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."

Question 4:
We need Django migrations because that is how we apply the changes we make in our models
to our database.

Question 5:
A login form for the superuser.
You create the model class in models.py, then apply the models in admin.py.

Question 6:
Each /polls/38/ tells me which question I'm on. Adding results or vote tells me the results of question 38 or that I'm voting on question 38.
I get a 404 page not found if I don't exclusively use numbers for the question ID.
To fix this, I simply change int to str in the url paths.
